- Security: Multiple XSS vulnerabilities
- Performance: No offline support, 300KB+ page loads
- Privacy: External CDN dependencies
- Deployment: Manual file management

### After Improvements:
- Security: CSP protected, input sanitized, XSS prevented
- Performance: <200KB standalone, offline-first, PWA installable
- Privacy: Zero tracking, local-only data, optional identity
- Deployment: One command build, zero config needed

## 🎯 Key Achievements
